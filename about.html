        <div id="pronouns">Prounouns: He/Him & They/Them</div>
        <p>I'm known as Munsterlandr, and I am a furry and therian with autism and ADHD. I'm also part of a plural system; collectively, we call ourselves The Crew.</p>

        <!--<img src="rec/formDiagram.svg" alt="TODO" id="form-graph"> form graph is outdated, planning on figuring out some HTML+CSS magic focused way instead anyways -->
        <p>Though I am human in physical form, that just isn't <em>me.</em> My ideal form would not be human, but rather something with fur, dexterous paws, digitigrade legs, and a long ‒ and usually prehensile ‒ tail; beyond that, though, it flip-flops between a handful of forms, with certain traits appearing or disappearing. I usually stick with the term Therian, but also often use the term Otherkin as these forms often are quite detailed.</p>
        <div id="form-blurb">
            <p>Previously, I had an SVG of a graph I made to explain em (as previously stated, they get complex), but it's kind of become outdated lol. I plan on making something that uses HTML and CSS to create the form graph instead, but in the meantime, here's a large blurb.</p>
            <h3>Forms of Mine:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Moth-Canid-Dragon Thing</h4>
                    <p>White fur, golden antennae, occasionally grey or black markings. Tail is long, prehensile, and has a funky thing at the end of it.</p>
                    <p>Often more humanoid, but sometimes not. Often with four arms/forelimbs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Amphimorpho</h4>
                    <p>Similar colour scheme to moth-like form, but gold pawpads and inner goop, as well as some black markings.</p>
                    <p>Species is made by Tuxedodragon, check out their page on it <a href="https://amphimorpho.carrd.co/">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Often more animalistic, but sometimes more humanoid. Antennae and four forelimbs often cross over from moth-like form.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Yinglet</h4>
                    <p>Frankly, haven't "spotted" this form's colour scheme. Definitely a smaller one zho.</p>
                    <p>Yinglets are from zhe webcomic <em>Out of Placers</em>, which can be read <a href="https://www.valsalia.com/">here</a>. Be warned it is for adult audiences.</p>
                    <p>Size "felt" can fluctuate, feels more like my brain trying to map it to my physical body though. Moth-like antennae as zhe eyewhiskers shows up at times.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fox-Opossum Hybrid</h4>
                    <p>Colours are somewhat of a blend of those of the two animals, and fluctuate often. This form is pretty rare nowadays for me to feel.</p>
                    <p>Can be more humanoid or animalistic. The antennae and four forelimbs from the moth-like form often seep over.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
