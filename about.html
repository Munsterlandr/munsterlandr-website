        <div id="pronouns">Prounouns: He/Him & They/Them</div>
        <p>I'm known as Munsterlandr, and I am a furry and therian with autism and ADHD. I'm also part of a plural system; collectively, we call ourselves The Crew.</p>

            <p>Though I am human in physical form, that just isn't <em>me.</em> My ideal form would not be human, but rather something with fur, dexterous paws, digitigrade legs, and a prehensile tail; beyond that, though, it's pretty all over the place. I've made a graph to try and get that variation concisely summed up (see to the right), but in the future I may try my paw at making something I can just throw percentages in to get a graph out of.</p>
            <p>While the blobs of colour represent traits, the outlined boxes represent forms. Overlap means hybridization. Basically, if you threw a dart and it landed within at least one of the boxes, it'd be roughly the same probability as that form feeling ideal at the moment.</p>
            <p>One of the forms listed (Amphimorpho) is a species by <a href="https://tuxedodragon.art">TuxedoDragon</a>. They have a page that explains them far better.</p>
